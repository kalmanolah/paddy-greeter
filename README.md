paddy-greeter
========

Paddy-Greeter is a greeter(read: a login screen) for use with lightdm and lightdm-webkit-greeter.

It has pretty limited functionality, but looks pretty neat.
A screenshot of paddy-greeter in action can be found [here](https://github.com/kalmanolah/paddy-greeter/raw/master/src/screenshot.png).

It's called paddy because it's full of rice. It's a terrible pun and I feel like a bad person for finding it funny.

Documentation
-------------

You'll need to have lightdm and lightdm-webkit for this to work. On Debian-based systems, you'd do something like:

    sudo apt-get install lightdm lightdm-webkit-greeter

First, configure lightdm to use lightdm-webkit-greeter if you haven't already. To do so, open up `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` with vim or whatever and change it to something like this:

    [SeatDefaults]
    greeter-session=lightdm-webkit-greeter
    user-session=<Your XSession filename goes here (without .desktop)>
    allow-guest=<TRUE | FALSE - Enable the guest account?>

A properly configured `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` would look something like this:

    [SeatDefaults]
    greeter-session=lightdm-webkit-greeter
    user-session=gnome-awesome
    allow-guest=false

Next, configure lightdm-webkit-greeter to use paddy-greeter. You can do so by editing `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf` and setting `theme-name`to `paddy`:

    #
    # background = Background file to use, either an image path or a color (e.g. #772953)
    # theme-name = GTK+ theme to use
    # font-name = Font to use
    # xft-antialias = Whether to antialias Xft fonts (true or false)
    # xft-dpi = Resolution for Xft in dots per inch (e.g. 96)
    # xft-hintstyle = What degree of hinting to use (hintnone, hintslight, hintmedium, or hintfull)
    # xft-rgba = Type of subpixel antialiasing (none, rgb, bgr, vrgb or vbgr)
    #
    [greeter]
    theme-name=Ambiance
    webkit-theme=paddy
    font-name=Ubuntu 11
    xft-antialias=true
    xft-dpi=96
    xft-hintstyle=slight
    xft-rgba=rgb

Finally, clone the repo and copy the folder to the lightdm-webkit themes directory.

    git clone git://github.com/kalmanolah/paddy-greeter.git
    cp -R paddy-greeter /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/paddy

OPTIONAL: Change the distro image to something else, as I current don't have a way to determine your distro. Open up `js/main.js` and change `distro_image` to a distro logo of your choosing. It should correspond to `img/distro/<distro_image>`.

    distro_image = 'ubuntu.svg'; // distro image is 'img/distro/ubuntu.svg'
